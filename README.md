# 3D-Printable Cooling Fan Extension for Apple LC475

This is a 3D-printable fan extension designed to mount on top of the 60mm x 60mm x 10mm case fan of an Apple LC475 computer. 
The extension improves airflow by efficiently directing hot air away from the CPU cooler mounted on the built-in Motorola 68040 processor. 
This enhances cooling performance and system stability.

This modification is highly recommended to maintain optimal temperatures under high-performance conditions, especially if you overclock your LC475 to 33 MHz or 40 MHz.
The solution is split into two separate parts: the bottom part, which will be mounted with three screws on top of the original fan, and the top lid.
